          <p>
            I love building new things, starting from a blank whiteboard or early stage prototype and transforming it into something people
            truly value. I am full-stack developer with 5+ years of hands-on experience creating microservices, APIs, Desktop Application and
            Web Applications. I am familiar the Microsoft technology stack, including C#, .NET Core, and ASP.NET. I am also familiar with
            microservice architecture and cloud-based solutions (Microsoft Azure). While working in the industrial field, I learned to deliver
            critical software systems (highly available, secure, and fast). I am also a consultant willing to work closely with his clients. I also
            have a great passion for new technology, web development, art (particularly illustration), music (playing guitar and piano), and
            the outdoors. When Iâ€™m not on the job, I love hiking with my dog Ziyi, working my way through every recipe in the family
            cookbook, and including my love for seeing new places.
